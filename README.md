## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.

```shell
packagemanager install awesome-project
awesome-project start
awesome-project "Do something!"  # prints "Nah."
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`). This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.
